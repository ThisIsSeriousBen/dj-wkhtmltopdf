Introduction
------------

It works on `wkhtmltopdf <http://wkhtmltopdf.org/>`_. ``dj-wkhtmltopdf`` will allow user to organize their own pdf generator through django admin without any deployment :).

Mainly I was inspired by `django-wkhtmltopdf <https://github.com/incuna/django-wkhtmltopdf>`_. When I am working on Eccomerce project we want to generate invoice for orders.So we preferred wkhtmltopdf for pdf generator using django-wkhtmltopdf wrapper. Every time we are doing some modifications in local server and pushing this modifications into production but we have faced different(I mean design) issues in production,then we resolved issues in local and pushed into production,but it is so painful then I came to this thought.
